## Hello 👋 I'm Adrian Cardona

## 🚀 About Me 
I'm currently studying Computer Science at Los Angeles Harbor College, this fall, I'm transferring over to Califronia Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo (Or Cal Poly SLO for short). Going into my 3rd year of university as a comptuer science major, I'm excited to jump into the tech field and start contributing to the world of technology. I'm excited to put what I've learned in and outside the classroom to the test, and to learn along the way! 

## 🏟️ Hobbies 
I love to work out, whether it be lifting weights, running, and even going out on walks. Currently I'm trying to get back into gardening, but with school that has been a challenege. Prior to transferring to Cal Poly SLO, I did judo for nearly 2 years. A fun fact is I swam compeitvely for around 11 years before stopping once the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
